# Tailscale Role - Zero-Config VPN
# =================================
# Installs Tailscale for secure remote access from anywhere.
#
# What is Tailscale?
# ------------------
# Tailscale creates a private network between your devices using WireGuard.
# - Access your Deck from anywhere (home, work, travel)
# - No port forwarding or firewall changes needed
# - End-to-end encrypted (even Tailscale can't see your traffic)
# - Free for personal use (up to 100 devices)
#
# After Installation:
# -------------------
# 1. Open Tailscale from Application Menu (or run `tailscale up`)
# 2. Sign in with Google/Microsoft/GitHub/etc.
# 3. Authorize the device
# 4. Your Deck gets a Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x)
#
# Usage Examples:
# ---------------
#   # SSH from anywhere
#   ssh deck@100.x.x.x
#
#   # Use MagicDNS hostname (if enabled in Tailscale admin)
#   ssh deck@steamdeck
#
#   # Send files via Taildrop
#   tailscale file cp myfile.txt steamdeck:
#
# Tailscale + Sunshine/Moonlight:
# -------------------------------
# For remote game streaming, use Tailscale to connect your devices,
# then use the Tailscale IP in Moonlight. Works great for playing
# your Deck games from anywhere with decent internet.
#
# Troubleshooting:
# ----------------
# - Not connecting? Check `tailscale status`
# - Re-authenticate: `tailscale up`
# - Check if daemon is running: `systemctl status tailscaled`
