## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Run Command] --> B{First Run?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Dry Run Preview]
    C --> D[Review Output]
    D --> E[Push Logs]
    E --> F[Run bootible to Apply]
    B -->|No| G[Apply Changes]
    G --> H[Push Logs]
```

1. **Dry Run by Default** — First run previews all changes without applying them
2. **Review** — See exactly what will be installed and configured
3. **Logs Pushed** — Run logs are always pushed to your private repo
4. **Apply** — Run `bootible` to apply your configuration
