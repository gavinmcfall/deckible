# First Run Walkthrough

This guide walks through every step of your first Bootible run, explaining what happens at each stage.

---

## Before You Begin

!!! tip "Set your sudo password (Steam Deck)"
    If you haven't set a sudo password on your Steam Deck, open Konsole and run:
    ```bash
    passwd
    ```
    Enter a password when prompted. You'll need this during the Bootible run.

---

## Step 1: Run the Bootstrap Command

=== "Steam Deck"

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bootible.dev/deck | bash
    ```

=== "ROG Ally"

    ```powershell
    irm https://bootible.dev/rog | iex
    ```

### What Happens

1. **Script Download** — The bootstrap script is downloaded from `bootible.dev`
2. **Integrity Check** — SHA256 hash is verified to ensure the script wasn't tampered with
3. **Device Detection** — Bootible identifies your device type

---

## Step 2: Private Repository (Optional)

You'll be prompted:

```
Do you have a private configuration repository? [y/N]
```

### Option A: No Private Repo

Press ++enter++ or type `n` to use default settings.

- Bootible runs with sensible defaults
- Logs are saved locally but not synced
- Perfect for trying out Bootible

### Option B: Use Private Repo

Type `y` and enter your GitHub repository:

```
Enter your private repo (e.g., username/my-config): myuser/gaming
```

!!! info "First time? Set up your private repo first"
    See [Private Configuration](private-config.md) for how to set this up.

---

## Step 3: GitHub Authentication

If you specified a private repo, Bootible needs to access it.

### QR Code Login (Recommended)

A QR code appears on screen:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│           GitHub Device Authentication        │
│                                               │
│  Scan this QR code with your phone:           │
│                                               │
│         ██████████████████████████            │
│         ██                      ██            │
│         ██  ████████████████    ██            │
│         ...                                   │
│                                               │
│  Or visit: https://github.com/login/device   │
│  Code: ABCD-1234                              │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

1. Scan the QR code with your phone
2. Authorize the Bootible device login
3. The script continues automatically

!!! tip "Why QR code?"
    Gaming handhelds have on-screen keyboards that make typing painful. The QR code lets you authenticate using your phone, where typing is much easier.

---

## Step 4: Configuration Selection

If your private repo has multiple device configurations, you'll choose one:

```
Multiple configurations found:

  1) MySteamDeck
  2) MyRogAlly

Select configuration [1-2]:
```

Select the configuration for this device.

---

## Step 5: Dry Run Preview

Bootible now runs in **dry-run mode**, showing what would happen:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              Bootible - DRY RUN MODE                       ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

[DRY RUN] Would install: Discord
[DRY RUN] Would install: Spotify
[DRY RUN] Would install: VLC
[DRY RUN] Would configure: SSH server on port 22
[DRY RUN] Would enable: Decky Loader
[DRY RUN] Would install plugin: PowerTools
[DRY RUN] Would install plugin: ProtonDB Badges
...
```

### Review Carefully

- ✓ Check that expected apps are listed
- ✓ Verify system settings look correct
- ✓ Note any warnings or skipped items

!!! warning "Nothing has been changed yet"
    Dry-run mode only previews. No packages are installed, no settings are changed.

---

## Step 6: Apply Changes

If the preview looks good, apply your configuration:

=== "Steam Deck"

    ```bash
    bootible
    ```

=== "ROG Ally"

    ```powershell
    bootible
    ```

### What Happens During Apply

1. **Snapshot/Restore Point** — Creates a backup before making changes
2. **Package Installation** — Installs apps via Flatpak/winget
3. **Configuration** — Applies system settings
4. **Plugins** — Installs Decky plugins (Steam Deck)
5. **Cleanup** — Removes temporary files
6. **Log Push** — Uploads run log to your private repo

---

## Step 7: Review Results

After completion, you'll see a summary:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              Installation Complete!                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Installed:
  ✓ Discord
  ✓ Spotify
  ✓ VLC
  ✓ Decky Loader
  ✓ PowerTools plugin
  ✓ ProtonDB Badges plugin

Configured:
  ✓ SSH server enabled
  ✓ Tailscale installed

Next Steps:
  • Switch to Gaming Mode to see Decky plugins
