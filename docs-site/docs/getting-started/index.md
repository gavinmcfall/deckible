## Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "Is it safe to run?"
    Yes! Bootible runs in **dry-run mode** by default. The first run shows you exactly what would happen without making any changes. Only when you run `bootible` afterward are changes applied.

    Additionally:

    - **Windows**: Creates a System Restore Point before making changes
    - **Steam Deck**: Creates a btrfs snapshot before making changes

??? question "Do I need a GitHub account?"
    No, GitHub is optional. Without it:

    - You can still run Bootible with default settings
    - Logs are saved locally instead of pushed to a repo
    - You miss out on syncing configs across devices

    With a GitHub account:

    - Store your personal configuration in a private repo
    - Sync settings across multiple devices
    - Run logs are automatically pushed for debugging

??? question "Can I undo changes?"
    Yes!

    - **Windows**: Use System Restore to revert to the pre-Bootible state
    - **Steam Deck**: Restore from the btrfs snapshot created before running

??? question "What if I run it multiple times?"
    Bootible is **idempotent** — running it multiple times is safe. It will:

    - Skip packages already installed
    - Update configurations if they've changed
    - Not duplicate any settings
