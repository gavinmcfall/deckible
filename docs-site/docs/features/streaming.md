2. **Hardwire your host PC** - Reduces one wireless hop
3. **Same room/floor** - Minimizes WiFi distance
4. **Dedicated SSID** - Separate network for gaming if possible
5. **QoS** - Prioritize streaming traffic on router

### Remote Streaming (Outside Home)

For streaming outside your local network:

    ```

    Connect via Tailscale IP for encrypted tunnel.

=== "Port Forwarding"

    - Forward Sunshine port (47989/47984) on router
    - Less secure, more complex
    - May have NAT issues
